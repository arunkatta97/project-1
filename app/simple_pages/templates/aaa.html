                    The AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern has practically become the industry standard. It advises that
                    your test method be divided into three parts: arrange, act, and assert. Each of them is only in
                    charge of the section for which they were named.
                    So in the arrange section, you just have the code needed to run that particular test. Objects would
                    be created here, mocks would be put up (if you're using one), and expectations might be defined.
                    Then there's the Act, which is supposed to be the method's invocation. And on Assert, you'd just see
                    if the expectations had been met. More information is available HERE. </p>

                        pytest is a framework that makes complicated testing for applications and libraries simple to
                        design, test, and scale. It is the most widely used Python testing library. Plugins and
                        extensions are the foundation of a robust testing ecosystem.

                        Pytest is designed to be a very extensible system with easy to develop plugins, and there are
                        many plugins in the pytest that are used for a variety of reasons. Before releasing the code
                        into production, it is critical to test it thoroughly.
