                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                Continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment are abbreviated as CI and CD. In its most basic form, continuous integration (CI) is a modern software development method that involves making incremental code changes regularly and consistently. CI-triggered automated build-and-test stages ensure that code changes merged into the repository are trustworthy. As part of the CD process, the code is then provided swiftly and flawlessly. In the software sector, the CI/CD pipeline refers to the automation that allows incremental code changes to be delivered swiftly and reliably to production from developers' desktops.
